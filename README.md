Website Needs

Things We SHOULD have on our website

After viewing our website and researching some other Church sites, I have come up with a list of some areas we may need to focus on with our rebuild/new website project.

    ◦    The site should be the information hub that allows the viewer to have a clear picture of what your church is about.
    ⁃    Events, Classes, Rehearsals etc should be listed on the site
    ⁃    For those who are New: section that give them quick information about the church (location, service times, address, dress)
    ⁃    List of Leadership: Pastor, First Lady, Minister Staff/Deacon (who they cover)
    ⁃    Resources on becoming a member/plan of salvation/ study tools

    ◦    Focus on the BIG 6 (Men, Women, Singles, Family, Youth, Seasoned Saints)
    ⁃    Bullet points listing what those ministries goals are and contact information to connect
    ⁃    Image of the Leader so people will know WHO is leading those ministries
    ⁃    Resources for that particular ministry type

    ◦    Job connection: Is there a way to add job listing to our site for those members looking for employment

    ◦    Church Store/Generate Revenue
    ⁃    Offer church branded materials, Bibles, reading material (i.e. Pricilla Shirer books, other authors approved by our Pastor/First Lady

    ◦    Prayer Section
    ⁃    Either continue the Zoom Prayer or create a conference call (information listed on site)
    ⁃    Area for Praise Reports or Connect our Facebook feed so that the reports can be listed there

    ◦    Volunteer Page
    ⁃    Background check instructions 
    ⁃    Skill Assessment Form
    ⁃    A Confidentiality Form?
    ⁃    Code of Conduct/Standard of Christian Living Form

    ◦    Subscribers List
    ⁃    create a database for send out information regarding any and all church information
